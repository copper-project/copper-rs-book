# Learning Copper RS

Welcome to **Learning Copper RS**, a hands-on guide to building robots with the
[Copper](https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs) deterministic robotics operating system.

I learnt Rust by using the fantastic [Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/), so I
wanted to reproduce this experience with a book for
[Copper RS](https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs).

As of today, this project is purely personal and does not involve the Copper RS team, so
any missing or faulty information is my own responsibility. I've originally built this book
first and foremost for myself. I believe that the best way to properly understand a concept
is to be able to clearly and simply explain it.

This book has been written with the help of AI, for the sake of speed, proper grammar and
formatting, but each and every line has been reviewed by a human. I am personally using
this book to learn.

The source for this book is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/NRdrgz/copper-rs-book). Feedback and contributions are
welcome.

This book will take you from zero to a running Copper project, one concept at a time. By
the end, you'll understand how to define task graphs, write sensor drivers and processing
pipelines, and run everything with sub-microsecond deterministic scheduling.

## Who is this for?

This book is aimed at:

- **Robotics developers** coming from ROS / ROS 2 who want to explore a Rust-native
  alternative
- **Rust developers** interested in robotics and real-time systems
- **Beginners** who want a gentle, progressive introduction to Copper's architecture

No prior Copper experience is required. Familiarity with Rust syntax is helpful but any experience with other programming language should allow you to get through.

Let's get started!
