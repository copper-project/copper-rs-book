# Learning Copper RS

Welcome to **Learning Copper RS**, a hands-on guide to building robots with the
[Copper](https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs) deterministic robotics operating system.

I learnt Rust by using the fantastic [Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/), so I
wanted to reproduce this experience with a book for
[Copper RS](https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs).

This book will take you from zero to a running Copper project, one concept at a time. By
the end, you'll understand how to define task graphs, write sensor drivers and processing
pipelines, and run everything with sub-microsecond deterministic scheduling.

## Who is this for?

This book is aimed at:

- **Robotics developers** coming from ROS / ROS 2 who want to explore a Rust-native
  alternative
- **Rust developers** interested in robotics and real-time systems
- **Beginners** who want a gentle, progressive introduction to Copper's architecture

No prior Copper experience is required. Familiarity with Rust syntax is helpful but any experience with other programming language should allow you to get through.

Let's get started!
