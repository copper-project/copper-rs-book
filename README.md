# copper-rs-book

Most people learn Rust with the amazing [Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/), so we built it for [Copper RS](https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs).

This book has been written with the help of AI, for the sake of speed, proper grammar and formatting, but each and every line has been reviewed by a human.

## Read online

This book is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`:
